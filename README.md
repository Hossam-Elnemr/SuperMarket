# Project Description
The SQLite Cashier System project aims to create a simple cashier system using SQLite as the database backend.
The script allows you to add products to the database, process cashier transactions, and generate receipts.
It also includes functionality to track customer purchases and offers a discount after a certain number of purchases.

# Installation
$ pip install sqlite3

# Usage
Follow the prompts to interact with the cashier system.
-To add a product, enter "yes" when prompted and provide the product details (name, price, and barcode).
-To process a cashier transaction, enter "yes" when prompted and provide the customer's name and email,
the script will track the customer's purchase count and update the database accordingly.
-After processing the transaction, the script will display a receipt with the purchased products and the total price.
-The script also includes an offer that applies a discount if the customer has made five purchases.
